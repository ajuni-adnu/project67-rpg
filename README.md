### Phase 1 Rule

- **No loops, no functions yet.**
- Write the story and boss fight using explicit turn blocks.
- This will let you experience how branching logic grows in size and why weâ€™ll later refactor.

  # My notes:
  - Ending is concluding text only for dramatic style, sana walang minus if hindi victory/defeat/fatigue.
  - Amulet and rustbite doesn't appear in choosing which items to use since they're not useable items eitherway. However, they do work in the background.
  - Not forgiving in Scene 2 - 11, if you mistype: you do not get anything.
